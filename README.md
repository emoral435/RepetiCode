   A web app to get into the groove of tracking your lifts!
</p>

## Why was this made? ðŸ¤”ðŸ’­
* I would love to have a custom way to track the progression (or lack there of...) of my lifts, and have more control over the metrics surrounding my lifting
* Allowing others to get into the groove of tracking their lifts is something that would be very fulfilling for me!

## Try it out yourself!
Hosted on Railway, you can try out the application and register / log in to start or continue your lifting journey!

[Try it out for free](https://repetiswole-production.up.railway.app/)

To see more about the API's that are provided, please check out the `doc` folder within this repository! I try to keep it as updated as possible.

## How do I run this locally? ðŸ’šðŸ™‚
