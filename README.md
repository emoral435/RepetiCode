   A web app to get you into the groove and track what you'd want to learn within the field of software engineering.
</p>

## Why was this made? ðŸ¤”ðŸ’­
* I myself sometimes lose sight of what I would want to continue learning throughout my semesters at university, so having an application track the progress and information of the skills I want to uplevel would be handy!
* Allowing others to get into the groove of learning software engineering via spaced repetition, consistent practice, and an application to keep them responsbile would be highly fulfilling NGL!

## Screenshots of the application! ðŸ˜²ðŸš€

## How do I run this locally? ðŸ’šðŸ™‚
> [!NOTE]\
> This program is fully hosted right now via localhost and packages by a Docker container! In the future, this likely will be moved to GCP because UIUC gave me free credits LOL

With Docker Desktop installed and opened, you can run these commands at the root directory of this GitHub repo...
```shell
# if you are running this for the first time, or have made changes and want to see it take affect on its deployment, use this
docker compose up -d --build
# starts the application in its detached state
docker compose up -d
# turns off the application
docker compose down
# wipes the container clean, effectively deleting the volumes for the database
docker compose down -v
```
